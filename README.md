# Benchmarking Foundation Models on Exceptional Cases: Dataset Creation and Validation

We have developed an unprecedented dataset that transcends conventional commonsense, providing a more robust evaluation of FMs across multiple modalities for the first time. This dataset comprises four categories, including exceptional scenarios. Furthermore, it encompasses various tasks designed to assess capabilities such as instance classification, recognition, token prediction, and summarization.
